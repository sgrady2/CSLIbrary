This directory contains the header files for sig.  The header files
are divided into various subdirectories:

Self-contained libraries:
   sig        -- contains the union of all the following sub-libraries
   improv     -- library for interactive MIDI programs
   museinfo   -- library for musical information conversion/analysis

Sublibraries -- sets of code which are not independent of each other
(except perhaps sigBase):
   sigBase    -- basic classes that are useful to other sublibraries
   sigControl -- classes dealing with interactive MIDI performance
   sigInfo    -- classes dealing with musical information
   sigNet     -- classes for simulating neural networks
   sigSignal  -- DSP generation/filtering classes for sound signals
