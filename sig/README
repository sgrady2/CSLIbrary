INTRODUCTION

Sig++ is a collection of C++ classes and example programs which
demonstrate the use of these classes.  Sig++ is primarily intended
for generating/processing audio signals with soundfile input/output
to the example programs.  The primary example programs are called the
"sigFile" set.  Other example programs show how to communicate with MIDI
instruments (the improv example set) and how to read/write/process musical
scores (the museinfo example set), which may be useful in controlling the
audio components of sig++.

After you have created the example programs, try these commands 
to get started:

Create 10 seconds of whitenoise with an amplitude of 0.5:
   bin/whitenoise -d 10 -a 0.5 whitenoise.wav

Resonate the whitenoise with time-varying envelopes:
   bin/resonate  -f "0 100 1 2000 3 500" -b "0 100 1 10 2 1000" whitenoise.wav resonated.wav


=============================================================================

Here are the basic steps to make the sig++ library/example programs.
Type the following in order:

   make library
   make example
   make sound

If you only want the soundfile example programs, you could instead
type:

   make library
   make sigfile
   make sound

By default, the Makefiles are configured for Linux with Intel CPU's
using the Open Sound System interface for accessing soundcards.
Edit the makefiles if you have a different configuration.

Description of various files/directories in the sig directory tree:

src         -- Directory which contains the source code for making the
               sig library file.  
include     -- Directory containing header files for use when compiling
               programs using the sig library.
examples    -- Directory of source code for example programs which use the 
               sig library.
COPYRIGHT   -- The copyright notice.
README      -- This file.
VERSION     -- A file which lists what version of sig++ should be in in 
               this directory.
bin         -- Directory for binaries created from compiling the example 
               programs.
obj         -- Temporary object files created before the library file.
lib         -- Directory which contains (or will contain) the compiled library 
               files for sig.
sounds      -- Directory for storing example sounds.
