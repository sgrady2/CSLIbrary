This directory contains the source code for sig.  The source code
is divided into various subdirectories:

Sublibraries -- sets of code which are not independent of each other
(except perhaps sigBase):
   sigBase    -- basic classes that are useful to other sublibraries
   sigControl -- classes dealing with interactive MIDI performance, 
                 computer input/output and timing issues.
   sigInfo    -- classes dealing with musical information.
   sigNet     -- classes for simulating neural networks.
   sigSignal  -- DSP generation/filtering classes for sound signals.

Self-contained libraries:
   sig        -- contains the union of all the above sub-libraries.
   improv     -- library for interactive MIDI programs.
   museinfo   -- library for musical information conversion/analysis.
